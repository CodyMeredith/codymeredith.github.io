            <p class="articleText">BOISE, Idaho — The Boise non-profit CATCH is asking for donations this winter to keep people experiencing homelessness warm and safe as the temperatures begin to drop.<br>
                <br>
                Boise's homeless population is growing, according to Interfaith Sanctuary Executive Director Jodi Peterson-Stigers. This is a problem when her shelter, like others, has limited space. 
                She said that she sometimes has to turn away as many as 20 people in need.<br>
                <br>
                "It's a significant amount that are not able to be served by our shelter," Peterson-Stigers said. "So that's really hard for us and the demand is higher."<br>
                <br>
                As a result, many people facing homelessness must prepare for the worst: sleeping outside in freezing temperatures.<br>
                <br>
                "I do it every night," Frederick Hardt said. "You gotta dress properly. You gotta wear everything you got pretty much to stay warm."<br>
                <br>
                Hardt has been homeless for five years. Without the proper winter gear, freezing to death is a real danger. However, getting ahold of this gear isn't an easy task for some.<br>
                <br>
                Angel Summers and her boyfriend Jeffrey Jensen experienced this first-hand.<br>
                <br>
                "St. Vincent de Paul has a program and I got a voucher. And we went to one of the stores and the shelves are just - there aren't coats to choose from," Summers said. 
                "Until I find a coat, just layer up like I have been, wear as many long sleeve shirts as I can. Try to stay moving. Try to stay busy. Drink warm stuff. Do the best you can."<br>
                <br>
                It’s for these exact reasons CATCH is making a push for donations. It's an annual effort, but this year's donations are down compared to the past years, according to CATCH Street 
                Outreach Director Jette Curtis.<br>
                <br>
                "The need is huge right now," Curtis said. "So, there's a little bit of urgency."<br>
                <br>
                CATCH is asking for donations of the following items:</p>
                <ul class="articleText">
                    <li>Warm hats</li>
                    <li>Scarves</li>
                    <li>Socks</li>
                    <li>Gloves</li>
                    <li>Outdoor coats</li>
                    <li>Hand warmers</li>
                    <li>Thermal underwear (long johns)</li>
                    <li>Tarps</li>
                    <li>Blankets</li>
                    <li>Flashlights</li>
                    <li>Backpacks</li>
                    <li>Small propane bottles</li>
                    <li>Gift cards to grocery stores and gas stations</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="articleText">Donations can be dropped off at the temporary CATCH office at Catholic Charities of Idaho at 7233 W Franklin Rd. 
                Donations can also be dropped off at their downtown Boise office at 503 S. Americana Boulevard.
